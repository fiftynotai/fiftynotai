# fifty.dev — Engineering Systems, Not Just Apps

```
Flutter • Game Systems • Offline-First • AI Agents • OSS
```

I build **systems**, not one-off apps.

My work lives at the intersection of **mobile engineering**, **game mechanics**, and **AI-assisted workflows** — focused on products that are modular, offline-capable, and designed to scale across real-world constraints.

This profile is a living archive of experiments, frameworks, and production-ready tooling under the **fifty.dev** ecosystem.

---

## Who I Am

* **Flutter Engineer** building cross-platform mobile experiences
* Builder of **offline-first**, **real-time**, and **game-driven** systems
* Heavy focus on **architecture**, **tooling**, and **developer velocity**
* Currently shaping an ecosystem around **AI agents + dev automation**

I don't chase trends — I design **foundations**.

## The fifty.dev Philosophy

> *"If it can't be reused, automated, or evolved — it's not done."*

**Core principles:**

* Modular over monolithic
* Offline-first by default
* Declarative > imperative
* Tools should feel like teammates
* Code is a product, not just implementation

## What You'll Find Here

### Fifty Flutter Kit — The Core Ecosystem

A comprehensive Flutter/Dart toolkit extracted from production apps:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **fifty_audio_engine** | Audio playback & recording (BGM/SFX separation) |
| **fifty_speech_engine** | Text-to-speech and speech-to-text |
| **fifty_sentences_engine** | Sentence building & word bank systems |
| **fifty_map_engine** | Cross-platform maps integration |
| **fifty_printing_engine** | ESC/POS printing (Bluetooth & WiFi) |
| **fifty_cache** | Multi-tier caching with TTL support |
| **fifty_storage** | Key-value storage abstraction |
| **fifty_connectivity** | Network monitoring + offline detection |
| **fifty_tokens** | Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) |
| **fifty_theme** | Theme generation and management |
| **fifty_ui** | Component library (buttons, cards, inputs) |
| **fifty_utils** | DateTime, responsive design, API state |

**Plus:**
- **MVVM + Actions template** — Full app scaffold with GetX
- **Demo app** — Showcases all packages

Built to be **documented**, **tested**, and **extended**.

### AI-Assisted Development (IGRIS)

**[igris-ai](https://github.com/fiftynotai/igris-ai)** — AI Engineering Platform: From Vibe Coding to Vibe Engineering

An AI persona/agent layer that supports:

* Multi-agent orchestration (18 native subagents)
* Brief management & session recovery
* Architecture enforcement & quality gates
* Code generation workflows

Think **AI as infrastructure**, not a feature.

---

### Game & Interactive Systems

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **fifty_map_engine** | Interactive map rendering |
| **fifty_sentences_engine** | Word/sentence game mechanics |
| **fifty_speech_engine** | Voice-driven gameplay |
| **flame-2d-game** | 2D game with Flame engine |
| **graph_builder** | Graph/node-based systems (C++) |

Games are just apps with stricter rules.

---

### Offline-First & Real-World Apps

Many packages are designed for:

* Limited connectivity (`fifty_connectivity`)
* Local storage (`fifty_storage`, `fifty_cache`)
* Multi-tier caching with TTL
* Long-running reliability

Because the real world isn't always online.

---

## Tech I Actually Use

**Mobile**
* Flutter (GetX primary)
* Custom MVVM + Actions architecture
* SQLite, GetStorage
* Flame Engine, CustomPainter

**Audio / Media**
* Custom audio abstraction (`fifty_audio_engine`)
* TTS / STT pipelines (`fifty_speech_engine`)

**Infra & Tooling**
* REST, WebSockets
* Firebase (Auth, FCM, Distribution)
* CI/CD (Fastlane, Codemagic)
* ESC/POS printing

**AI / Automation**
* Agent-based workflows (IGRIS)
* Prompt-driven tooling
* CLI-first thinking

---

## This Repo Is a Lab

Not everything here is "finished" — and that's intentional.

You'll find:

* Production-ready packages
* Extracted engines
* Experiments
* Forks and contributions

Some projects are **weapons**, some are **prototypes**, all are **learning artifacts**.

---

## What I'm Building Toward

* A cohesive **fifty.dev** open-source ecosystem
* AI agents that feel like senior teammates
* Developer tools that remove friction, not add abstraction
* Systems that survive scale, chaos, and time

---

## Final Note

If you're here looking for:

* Clean abstractions
* Thoughtful architecture
* Systems thinking
* Or just inspiration

You're in the right place.

> **Build once. Extract forever.**
